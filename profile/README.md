# Our Values

At NORMA, we build software and AI with people at the core.  
Craft matters. People matter more.

## 🤝 Team Culture

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 People before results  
We care about impact, but never at the expense of humans. Empathy leads, excellence follows.

🙌 Low shame, high trust  
Confidence grows when blame disappears. What matters is how we respond. We create a safe space to speak up, try, fail, and improve without fear.

💡 Assume good will  
Trust is our default. We believe in each other’s good intentions, even when things are unclear or go wrong. We can criticize work, not people.

🗣️ Dare to disagree  
Speaking up is part of the job. If you're not convinced, say it. We grow through honest feedback and respectful pushback.

🌍 Respect without exceptions  
We work across cultures and beliefs. We stay neutral on politics and religion. Everyone deserves respect—no exceptions.

## 🛠 Collaboration & Craft

🤝 Sharing is not optional  
We don’t hoard knowledge. We share what we learn, what we build, and what we struggle with. Teams move faster when everyone sees the whole picture.

🎥 Speak up, not just type  
A quick video or face-to-face conversation often beats a long thread. We value human interaction for real clarity.

🚧 Break the tunnel early  
Don't wait for perfect. Share rough drafts. Show your progress early. Feedback helps, silence doesn't.


📚 Learning & Growth

We never stop learning. Curiosity beats ego. We share lessons, ask questions, and learn from wins and mistakes alike. Growth is part of the job—for our craft, our team, and ourselves.
