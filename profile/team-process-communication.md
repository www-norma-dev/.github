# Guidelines for Time and Communication Management in a Remote Team

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Developers

**Task Management:**  
Developers are responsible for organizing their daily work. They collaborate with the Tech Lead to prioritize tasks and break them into the smallest possible units.

> _Why small tasks?_  
> Small tasks simplify communication, reviews, visibility, and refactoring. Ideally, a task should take between 2 hours and 1 day.

If a task cannot be broken down, mitigate confusion through regular updates and clear communication with the team.

> _What about R&D?_  
> Some tasks involve exploration or technical research (e.g., testing new tools, benchmarking, architectural decisions). In these cases, the team allocates a defined number of days for focused R&D, followed by a clear restitution (demo, note, or shared summary). These are tracked and communicated just like any other task.

**Ownership:**  
Developers are responsible for:

- Proposing architecture and preparing any pre-requisites for their work.
- Testing their implementations and ensuring DevOps compatibility.
- Documenting the project in the shared knowledge management folder (never a personal drive) to ensure team access and avoid redundancy or sync issues.
- Refactoring code when necessary.
- Voicing concerns or alternative ideas if they are not convinced by a technical direction or task scope. Thoughtful disagreement is encouraged.

**Process Adherence:**

- Follow ticket order as defined by the Tech Lead. Do not start a ticket without their validation—this prevents duplication and misalignment.
- Keep the ticket management system up to date to reflect task progress and maintain sprint board accuracy.
- Push your code to a pull request (PR) by the end of each day. Only the developer may merge their PR.
- Time can be allocated during the week for certification preparation or internal learning—coordinate this with your Tech Lead.

### Tech Lead

**Team Productivity:**

- Monitor team performance and ensure no developer stays blocked for too long.
- Foster growth by sharing best practices, mentoring junior developers, and encouraging autonomy.
- Create space for constructive disagreement and ensure everyone's voice is heard, especially during planning or architecture discussions.

**Technical Ownership:**

- Act as the team’s voice, especially in discussions with the Product Owner (PO) regarding priorities and backlog reviews.
- Take on critical tasks or those with significant strategic impact.
- Regular pair programming with developers is encouraged.

**Review and Demo:**

- Serve as the final reviewer for pull requests.
- Prepare for demos with the team, but delegate or share presentation responsibilities to promote shared ownership.

### Product Owner (PO)

**Feature Ownership:**

- Define what needs to be done and its priority.
- While the team does not set the order of features, developers are encouraged to raise concerns if sprint scopes require adjustment.
- Respect team feedback, especially around feasibility and workload distribution.

## Communication in a Remote Setup

### Why Communication is Key

In a remote environment, we lack body language and spontaneous interactions. Clear, inclusive communication bridges this gap, ensuring smooth workflows and strong team relationships.

**Video Over Text:**  
Use video calls to resolve complex issues or strengthen team bonds. Avoid lengthy text threads when a quick call can bring clarity.

**Team messaging platform channels over private discussions:**  
Use dedicated team messaging platform channels to communicate with the team. This keeps everyone informed and fosters transparency.

**Availability:**  
- Notify the team on the team messaging platform if you’re unavailable for more than one hour during regular working hours.
- Use your status indicator to let the team know if you’re available or absent.

**End-of-Day Check-In:**  
Be available for a short end-of-day call when possible to align, unblock others, and wrap up open topics.

**Shared Responsibility:**  
We commit as a team to deliver agreed-upon tasks and maintain transparency. Poor communication from one member can lead to stress, misalignment, or duplicated work for others.

**Respect and Inclusion:**  
- Respect timezones, working styles, and cultures.
- Keep communication clear, neutral, and inclusive. Avoid political, religious, or culturally sensitive expressions in the work context.

## Special Attention on Fridays

Fridays are key for wrapping up the week. Make sure all pending tasks, updates, and communications are addressed. Begin this process early in the afternoon to avoid last-minute pressure.

## Learning and Growth

Learning is part of our job. At NORMA, we:

- Value curiosity over ego.
- Share lessons, not just results.
- Fund certifications for our team members.
- Allocate time during work hours for learning and preparation. Coordinate with your Tech Lead to plan your upskilling path.
