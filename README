# Our Values

At NORMA, we build software and AI with people at the core.  
Craft matters. People matter more.

## 🤝 Team Culture

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 People before results  
We care about impact, but never at the expense of humans. Empathy leads, excellence follows.

🙌 Low shame, high trust  
Confidence grows when blame disappears. What matters is how we respond. We create a safe space to speak up, try, fail, and improve without fear.

💡 Assume good will  
Trust is our default. We believe in each other’s good intentions, even when things are unclear or go wrong. We can criticize work, not people.

🗣️ Dare to disagree  
Speaking up is part of the job. If you're not convinced, say it. We grow through honest feedback and respectful pushback.

🌍 Respect without exceptions  
We work across cultures and beliefs. We stay neutral on politics and religion. Everyone deserves respect—no exceptions.

## 🛠 Collaboration & Craft

🤝 Sharing is not optional  
We don’t hoard knowledge. We share what we learn, what we build, and what we struggle with. Teams move faster when everyone sees the whole picture.

🎥 Speak up, not just type  
A quick video or face-to-face conversation often beats a long thread. We value human interaction for real clarity.

🚧 Break the tunnel early  
Don't wait for perfect. Share rough drafts. Show your progress early. Feedback helps, silence doesn't.
